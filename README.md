# KanDuSurfe
Small web service that returns whether or not the weather is suited for kite surfing in the coming week in Copenhagen.

Using YR Api and is implemented in rust, and deployed as an Azure Function 

Can be used as a simple example how to build an Azure Function in Rust. Comments are appreciated.

Cheers
